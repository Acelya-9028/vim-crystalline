# vim-crystalline

Want a nice statusline in Vim?
[vim-airline](https://github.com/vim-airline/vim-airline/) too slow?
[lightline.vim](https://github.com/itchyny/lightline.vim/) too verbose?
`vim-crystalline` is for you.

`vim-crystalline` has functions that you can use to build a fancy statusline while still using Vim's own powerful statusline customization functionality.
That way, you can avoid hundreds of lines of configuration while keeping the vanilla flavor.

It also comes with a bufferline!
